# Search Algorithm

Searching is the process of finding an item with specified properties from a collection of items.

## Linear Search

Linear search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds an element that matches the searching value.

### Unordered Linear Search

Let us assume we are given an array where the order of the elements is not known. That means the elements of
the array are not sorted. In this case, to search for an element we have to scan the complete array and see if the
element is in the given array or not.

### Sorted / Ordered Linear Search

If the elements of the array are already sorted, then in many cases we don't have to scan the complete array to
see if the element is there in the given array or not.

If the value `arr[-1]` is greater than the data to be searched, then we just return `-1` without searching the remaining array.

__Time Complexity:__ `O(n)`

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms such as the binary search and hash tables allow significantly faster searching comparison to Linear search.

## Binary Search

`Binary search` is used to search an element in a `sorted list` of elements by repeatedly dividing the search interval in `half`.

`Binary search` works by comparing the `value` to search for with the `middle value` of the `sorted list`.

- It begin with an `interval` covering the whole `list` of elements, getting the `middle value`. (it splits list by two halves).

- Check if the `middle value` is equal to the `value` weâ€™re searching for.

- If the value is higher than the `middle value`, then the search proceeds in the `right half` of the `list`.

- If the value is lower than the `middle value`, then the search proceeds in the `left half` of the `list`.

- This process is repeated comparing the `searching value` and the `middle value` until the `value` is found or the `interval` is empty and the `searching value` is not in the `list`.

note : A `binary search tree` is a `binary tree` data structure that works based on the principle of `binary search`.

The `binary search` pattern is based on the `divide and conquer` algorithm technique.

`binary search` reduces the search complexity to `O(log(n))`.

The algorithm may be implemented in different ways using `iterative` or `recursive` approach.

The number of possible divisions is proportional to the power of two that will give us the total
number of elements in the list.

if the `sorted list` contain 10 000 elements then number of possible divisions is `log2(10 000) = 13.28`.
